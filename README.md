Our project, “Universal Currency Recognition for the Visually Impaired,” is an initiative aimed at empowering visually impaired individuals by enabling them to identify various currency banknotes independently. We recognize the significant challenges faced by those with vision impairments in daily financial transactions, primarily due to the difficulty in distinguishing between different banknotes. To address this, our project utilizes predictive modeling techniques, leveraging a comprehensive dataset from Microsoft’s BankNote-Net, which includes a wide array of currency images. We employ a Neural Network optimized for feature extraction and currency recognition, focusing on enhancing financial inclusivity and accessibility for the visually impaired.

Our neural network demonstrated an accuracy rate of 95% in recognizing currencies, showing considerable promise for practical application. Despite encountering challenges such as data imbalance and varying image quality, we are committed to advancing this project. Our future goals include improving the model’s deep learning features, expanding the dataset, and integrating multi-angle image processing. This will enable the development of a real-time mobile application, furthering our mission to provide visually impaired individuals with a reliable tool for independent and secure financial transactions.
